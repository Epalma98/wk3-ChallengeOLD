## Installation

Load up the webpage at:


## Usage

After loading up the webpage, you'll click the "Generate Password" button. You'll then be required to answer a few prompts. 

The first prompt is mandatory to fill out, which is the number of characters desired in the generated password. If you choose an amount that is outside the range of 8-128, it'll ask you again to enter a value within the range.

After the desired number of characters is given, you'll then be asked if you want lowercase, uppercase, numbers, and special characters included in the password.

After answer "ok" or "cancel" to those criteria, the webpage will give you a randomized password.
